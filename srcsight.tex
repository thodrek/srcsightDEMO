\begin{abstract}
Lately there has been a rapid increase in the number of data sources and public access data services, such as cloud-based data markets and data portals, that facilitate the collection, publishing and trading of data. Data sources typically exhibit large heterogeneity in the type and quality of data they provide. Unfortunately, when the number of data sources is large, humans have a limited capability of reasoning about the actual usefulness of sources and the trade-offs between the benefits and costs of acquiring and integrating sources. In this demonstration we present \system , a framework that facilitates the exploration and selection of sources for integration. \system is based on the intuition that different sets of data sources are optimal to integrate for different integration tasks. The main focus of \system is to allow users to discover and explore valuable sets of sources for diverse integration tasks over real-world event-data sources.

\section{Introduction}
Given the increasing number of available data sources and the fact that acquiring and integrating data involves a monetary cost, it is challenging for a user to identify sources that are truly beneficial for her application.
